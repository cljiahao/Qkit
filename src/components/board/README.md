# board

## Purpose

The vendor's order ticket and what hangs off it: the status badge and the
payment-proof viewer. Rendered by the live order board and by the
completed-orders history.

## Contents

- `order-card.dom.test.tsx` — RTL tests for `OrderCard`'s status/payment
  transitions, action-button wiring, the `displayNumber` override, the
  walk-up origin badge, the batch-select checkbox, and the reconciled "Mark
  paid & start" review action — the merged button (not two) for a pending
  order with an outstanding payment claim, on both a QR and a walk-up order,
  the plain Start-now button once payment is already settled, and that
  tapping/undoing it calls `confirmPaymentAndStart`/`revertPaymentAndStart`.
- `order-card.tsx` — `OrderCard`, the vendor's order ticket, laid out for
  reading at a counter: the number (largest, last digit in the accent colour)
  and the customer's name, one line of always-visible options per item (the
  vendor's short codes via `optionCodes` where set, see `@/lib/ticket`), a
  single `AttentionLine` chosen by `ticketAttention` in place of stacked
  badges, and one next-step button (`TicketActions`). Bump and cancel sit in
  a `TicketMenu` dropdown; "Preparing" and "Paid" go unstated. `showDate`
  switches on the history view: date and time, per-line prices and the
  total, none of which the live board shows. The notes below predate this
  layout and describe behaviour that is unchanged (undo, payment review,
  auto-clear, batch select). Signature: `OrderCard({ order, displayNumber,
  overtaken, optionCodes, boothName, agingMin,
overdueMin, onUndoWindowChange, showDate, undoMs, readyAutoClearMs, selectable,
selected, onToggleSelect })`. Item options start expanded, not collapsed behind
  "Show options": whoever writes the order onto a cup needs every
  customisation, and a collapsed card cost one tap per order, over a hundred in
  a service. The toggle remains, for a vendor scanning numbers rather than
  making drinks. The customer name and item names wrap rather than truncate,
  since a cut-off name is what gets written on the cup and called out. A
  walk-up order is tagged "· walk-up" beside the name (no phone to notify, so
  staff call it), except one keyed in without a name: that is saved as
  "Walk-up", and the tag would print the word twice (`showsWalkupTag`). With
  `overtaken` (from `overtakenOrderIds` in `@/lib/orders`, set by the board) the
  card carries a "Passed over" badge: a later order from the same booth is
  already out, so this one was probably finished without anyone marking it. The
  rest: the
  vendor dashboard's live order ticket — status/payment badges (plus a
  "Print failed" badge, `PrintBadge`, when `order.print_status === "failed"`
  — silent for `queued`/`sent`/`printed`/`not_required`, set via printkit's
  `POST /api/printkit/print-status` callback — and a
  "Walk-up" badge when `order.source === "walkup"`, staff-entered orders vs.
  the default QR-placed ones — `PaymentBadge`/`PrintBadge`/the inline
  walk-up pill all render through one local `MiniPill({label, className})`,
  since all three shared the identical pill class fingerprint before this
  extraction), an aging
  clock (`orderAgeTone`, ticks every 30s) moved to the footer beside the
  arrival timestamp (`sgtClock`, bare time — or `shortDateTime`, date+time,
  when `showDate` is set, for the completed-orders history list where every
  card isn't from today), expandable item options, and the advance/cancel/
  confirm-payment action buttons wired to `@/app/dashboard/order-actions`. A
  still-`pending` order with an outstanding payment claim (`payment_status`
  not `confirmed`/`not_required` — keyed on order state via `needsPaymentReview`
  in `@/lib/orders`, not `order.source`, so an unpaid walk-up order gets it
  too) collapses the separate confirm-payment and Start-now buttons into one
  "Mark paid & start" tap (`confirmPaymentAndStart`) — there's no real
  scenario where a vendor confirms payment without also starting the order.
  Its undo (within the same `undoMs` window as every other advance) calls the
  dedicated `revertPaymentAndStart`; both undo actions preserve confirmed
  payments. The card's `pendingUndo` state carries an `action:
"advance" | "paymentAndStart"` tag so its one undo button dispatches to
  whichever action made the original change.
  Pickup never confirms payment. Completed unpaid orders retain an explicit
  Paykit-backed settlement action and proof review; cancelled orders do not.
  Advancing (Mark Ready/Mark Picked Up) fires instantly — no confirm gate on
  a tapped-dozens-of-times-a-shift button — backed instead by an `undoMs`
  (default `DEFAULT_UNDO_MS`, 4s; vendor-configurable via
  `board_settings.undo_seconds * 1000`) undo window: the button becomes an
  Undo affordance with a left-to-right drain (`.undo-bar` in `globals.css`,
  duration set inline to match `undoMs`), and `onUndoWindowChange(orderId,
  active)` tells the board to keep a just-completed (terminal) order on the
  active grid for that window, since the realtime echo of the very write
  being offered for undo would otherwise filter the card off the board
  first. While `status === "ready"` and `readyAutoClearMs` is set
  (`board_settings.ready_auto_clear_min * 60_000`, vendor-configurable,
  `null` when the vendor hasn't turned auto-clear on), "Mark Picked Up"
  shows the same left-to-right drain (`.autoclear-bar`, reusing `.undo-bar`'s
  `undo-drain` keyframe) for the time left before `sweepReadyOrders`
  auto-completes it — set once (in an effect keyed on `ready_at`/`status`/
  `readyAutoClearMs`, not recomputed every poll tick) so it drains smoothly
  from a fixed duration instead of restarting on every re-render; purely
  display, the actual clearing stays server-side. `displayNumber` (optional,
  board_settings.daily_order_number_reset
  — see `displayOrderNumber` in `@/lib/orders`) overrides what's shown/
  referenced everywhere the card names "this order" by number — the
  name/number block itself, and its own cancel confirm dialog — falling back
  to the real `order.order_number` when omitted (every call site except the
  live board itself, e.g. the completed-orders history list, which
  intentionally always shows the real, permanent number). The shown number's
  trailing digit is emphasized in its own `<span>` (`splitTrailingDigit` in
  `@/lib/orders`) so a vendor using a physical pickup-shelf-slot system
  (bubble-tea-chain style — slotting an order by its last digit) can read it
  at a glance. The name/number block sits beside a dedicated bump icon chip
  — an instant tap, no confirm dialog (2026-09-15 — dropped the dialog to
  match `advanceStatus`'s own instant-tap rationale below: a mis-bump has no
  real consequence, just an order prepped slightly out of its natural order),
  disabled once already bumped.
  In multi-booth view, a full-width banner above the header shows the booth
  name next to a `boothColor()` dot. One "attention wash" background at a
  time, prioritized overdue > payment-claimed > aging. The footer's elapsed
  "Nm" label and the aging tone come from `useNow`, which is `null` until
  mount, so the card SSRs with no label and a "fresh" tone and fills both in on
  the client (no hydration text mismatch). A closed card whose
  `order.auto_completed` is true (the ready-order auto-clear sweep, not a
  vendor's own "Mark Picked Up" tap, completed it) shows a "Restore to
  ready" button calling `restoreAutoCompleted` — this is where the
  completed-orders history list's undo for a premature auto-clear lives —
  alongside a Cancel option (hidden once payment is confirmed, same as the
  live Cancel button) calling the same `cancelOrder`, since the sweep can
  beat a vendor's own cancel tap to it and the only other way to actually
  cancel that order would be restoring it to ready first. `selectable` (set
  by the board only for `preparing` orders while its own batch mark-ready
  mode is on) renders a `Checkbox` (`selected`, `onToggleSelect(order.id)`)
  next to the name/number block — selection state and the bulk `advanceOrder`
  call itself live on `RealtimeOrderBoard`, not here. A non-cancelled order
  with `payment_status === "claimed"` and an uploaded proof photo also shows
  a dashed "View payment proof" toggle (`ProofPhotoTrigger`, local to this
  file) that lazily mounts `PaymentProofViewer` (`./payment-proof-viewer.tsx`,
  `next/dynamic`) only once expanded, so the OCR worker never loads for a
  card the vendor hasn't opened.
- `order-status-badge.tsx` — `OrderStatusBadge({ status })`: a colour-coded
  pill for each `OrderStatus` (pending/confirmed/preparing/ready/completed/
  cancelled), shared by the dashboard board and the customer status page.
  Thin wrapper around `@merqo/ui`'s shared `StatusBadge` (extracted from this
  file, the chosen design target over other kits' plain shadcn `Badge` uses)
  — keeps qkit's own `STATUS_CONFIG` label/colour map, passed through as the
  `config` prop; same rendered markup as before.
- `payment-proof-viewer.dom.test.tsx` — RTL tests for `PaymentProofViewer`'s
  no-photo (renders nothing), duplicate-order-flag, and OCR amount-match/
  mismatch/failure branches, with `tesseract.js` and the two `proof-actions.ts`
  reads mocked.
- `payment-proof-viewer.tsx` — `PaymentProofViewer({ orderId,
expectedAmountCents })`: `"use client"`, always dynamically imported
  (`order-card.tsx`'s `ProofPhotoTrigger`) so `tesseract.js` never loads for a
  card the vendor hasn't opened. On mount, fetches the signed proof-photo URL
  and any duplicate-hash match (`@/app/dashboard/proof-actions`) in parallel,
  renders nothing until a photo URL resolves, then shows the photo plus a
  duplicate-photo warning ("This photo was already used for order #N") when
  one exists. Separately spins up a self-hosted (`/public/tesseract`, not the
  default jsDelivr CDN — keeps every asset same-origin under this app's CSP,
  which has no third-party `script-src`/`connect-src` allowance) `tesseract.js`
  worker (`workerBlobURL: false`, since this app's CSP has no `worker-src`/
  `child-src` to permit the library's default `blob:` worker spawn) to OCR the
  photo and compares the recognized text against `expectedAmountCents`,
  matching complete monetary tokens and showing "Amount matches $X.XX" or "Couldn't confirm the amount, check
  manually" — a hint only, never blocking the vendor's own manual review
  action, and any OCR failure (worker init, recognition) just leaves the hint
  unset rather than surfacing an error. The amount hint directs vendors to verify in their payment app; OCR never asserts settlement. Workers terminate on completion, failure, and unmount, and results from an earlier order/amount are hidden.
