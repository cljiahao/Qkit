# landing

## Purpose

The "QKit" wordmark surfaces and the site chrome shared across the
landing page and `/about`: the sticky top nav, the footer, and the plain
inline mark used on the login page.

## Contents

- `nav.tsx` — `Nav({ authed })`: the sticky top nav, shared by the
  landing page and `/about`. Composes `@merqo/ui`'s `LandingNav` shell
  (sticky positioning, background blur, border, and the responsive
  `end`-slot gap all live there) — this file supplies only the wordmark
  and right-side content: a plain `<a href="/#top">` (not `next/link`'s
  `Link` — a same-page hash jump needs a native anchor so the URL bar's
  hash always updates, which `Link` doesn't reliably do when only the
  fragment changes) as `wordmark`, and, as `end`, "FAQ" (`/#faq`, an
  absolute path since this nav also renders on `/about`, not just `/`)
  and "About" links plus either a "Dashboard" link (`authed`) or "Sign
  in" + "Get started" links (signed out).
- `nav.test.tsx` — asserts the About/FAQ/Sign-in/Get-started/Dashboard
  link targets.
- `footer.tsx` — `Footer()`: the site footer, shared by the landing page
  and `/about` (previously inlined in `src/app/page.tsx`, extracted so
  `/about` could reuse it without duplicating the markup). Since 2026-09-16
  a thin wrapper around `@merqo/ui`'s own `Footer` (`wordmark`/`tagline`/
  `kitName` slots) — qkit's copy was found structurally identical to
  loopkit's and paykit's, differing only in that content, and promoted.
- `footer.test.tsx` — asserts the wordmark link, tagline, copyright line,
  About link, and Terms/Privacy links.
- `wordmark.tsx` — `Wordmark({ className })`: the standalone "QKit" mark (no
  link, no nav chrome) used by the login page's two panels, where the nav
  shell itself doesn't apply.
- `hero-preview-carousel.tsx` — `HeroPreviewCarousel()`: the landing hero's
  swipeable "live order board" carousel over `LANDING_BOARDS` — native
  scroll-snap plus pointer-drag and a 10s auto-advance timer (paused on
  interaction, skipped under reduced motion), decorative (`aria-hidden`).
- `hero-preview-carousel.dom.test.tsx` — RTL test for carousel dot
  navigation/active state.
- `landing-board.tsx` — `LandingBoard({ board })`: renders one "live order
  board" ticket container (title + active-count pulse badge) for the hero
  carousel, laying out its `LandingTicket`s in a 2-col grid.
- `landing-board.dom.test.tsx` — RTL test for `LandingBoard` rendering.
- `landing-boards.ts` — `LANDING_BOARDS`: static sample data for the 4 hero
  scenario boards (coffee cart, ice-cream cart, a payment-claim flow, a
  "rush" with aging/overdue tickets).
- `landing-cta.tsx` — `LandingCta({ href, children, variant, event })`: a
  landing-page call-to-action `Button`+`Link` that fires an optional
  analytics event (`logEvent`) on click before navigating.
- `landing-ticket.tsx` — `LandingTicket({ t })`: presentational "order chit"
  mirroring the real `OrderCard`'s layout for the landing hero: a large
  number and name, every option on one line with nothing to expand, a single
  attention line ("Not paid yet", "Says paid. Check the payment", same wording
  as `ticketAttention`), a status badge only past preparing, the aging wash,
  and one action button that carries the amount when it confirms a payment.
  No prices or total, as on the live board. No server actions, purely
  decorative sample data.
- `landing-ticket.dom.test.tsx` — RTL test for `LandingTicket` rendering
  across status/payment/age combinations, the single attention line, and
  options shown without a toggle.

## Connectivity

`nav.tsx`'s `Nav` and `footer.tsx`'s `Footer` are rendered by both
`src/app/page.tsx` (the landing page) and `src/app/about/page.tsx`.
`wordmark.tsx`'s `Wordmark` is rendered by `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.
None of these are used by the vendor dashboard, which has its own wordmark
markup inlined in `src/app/dashboard/dashboard-nav.tsx` (also composing
`@merqo/ui`, via `DashboardNav` rather than `LandingNav`).
