# icon-192

## Purpose

Serves the 192×192 PWA/manifest icon at a stable URL (app-dir generated icon
routes carry a content hash in their URL, which `manifest.ts` can't reference).

## Contents

- `route.tsx` — `GET()` route handler: returns `new ImageResponse(brandIcon(192),
{ width: 192, height: 192 })`, rendering the shared `brandIcon` JSX
  (`@/lib/brand-icon`) to a PNG via `next/og`.

## Connectivity

Referenced by the web app manifest as the 192×192 icon entry; renders the same
`brandIcon()` helper used by `icon-512/route.tsx` at a different size, so both
stay visually identical.
