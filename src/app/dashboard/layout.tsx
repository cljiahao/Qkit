        @merqo/ui's DashboardNav renders its own <header> (sticky/border/
        padding already baked in) — this used to be qkit's own <header>
        wrapper before DashboardNav composed the shared component, but two
        <header> landmarks nested inside each other double the border/
        padding and are invalid semantics. A plain <div> keeps the one thing
        that <header> wasn't already covering (print:hidden) without adding
        a second landmark.

        `contents` is load-bearing, not decorative: the inner <header> is
        `position: sticky`, which is constrained to its containing block. A
        plain wrapper div's box IS that containing block, and it's exactly
        the header's own height, so the header would never have room to
        stick — it'd scroll away like a static element. `display: contents`
        removes the wrapper's own box from layout, so <header> becomes a
        direct flex item of this component's `min-h-screen flex flex-col`
        container instead — the same containing block it had pre-migration,
        when qkit's own <header> was that flex item directly. `print:hidden`
        still wins under `@media print` since `display: none` on an
        ancestor hides descendants regardless of their own `display` value.
