## Purpose

Next.js App Router tree — every page, layout, route handler, and PWA manifest file for this project.

## Contents

- `(auth)/` — vendor login and password-reset pages (route group, no URL segment).
- `about/` — `AboutPage`, the public "Why Merqo" page. The story itself is
  `@merqo/ui`'s shared `AboutMerqo` component (one source, reused by
  merqo's own `/about` and every other kit's); this page supplies only
  `Nav`/`Footer` and a "See how qkit works" CTA. Linked from `Nav` and
  `Footer`.
- `actions/` — server actions shared across routes: analytics events, feedback, purchase (upgrade) requests, support messages.
- `admin/` — internal admin dashboard (vendor management, pricing, feedback, support inbox).
- `api/` — route-handler API endpoints: the Merqo cross-product integration and qkit's own `v1` public API.
- `apple-icon.tsx` — `AppleIcon` route handler; renders `brandIcon(180)` (from `@/lib/brand-icon`) as a 180×180 PNG `ImageResponse` for iOS home-screen touch icons.
- `auth/` — Supabase auth callback route (OAuth/recovery code exchange).
- `dashboard/` — authenticated vendor area (realtime order board, booth/menu management, stats).
- `error.tsx` — `Error` client component, the root React error boundary; replaces the Next dev overlay in production, logs via `console.error`, shows a "Try again" button calling `reset()`.
- `global-error.tsx` — `GlobalError` client component; the boundary Next renders only when the **root layout itself** throws, so it ships its own `<html>/<body>` with inline styles (no Tailwind, since `globals.css` may not have loaded).
- `globals.css` — Tailwind v4 entry point: `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@import "tw-animate-css"`, and `@source "../../node_modules/@merqo/ui/dist"` (tells Tailwind to scan the built `@merqo/ui` package for utility classes to generate, since it lives outside `src/` and wouldn't otherwise be picked up by Tailwind's default content scan); theme tokens (OKLCH colors, `--font-*` variables), base layer, and custom utility classes (`.ticket`, `.perforation`, `.fade-rise`, `.undo-bar` — the left-to-right drain on `OrderCard`'s advance-undo affordance; the 4s here is only a fallback, `OrderCard` sets an inline `animation-duration` matching its vendor-configurable `undoMs` prop — `.autoclear-bar` — the same drain (reuses `.undo-bar`'s `undo-drain` keyframe) on `OrderCard`'s "Mark Picked Up" button while a ready order is counting down to `sweepReadyOrders`' auto-clear, duration set inline per order — `.hold-fill-bar` — the fill on `CloseBoothControl`'s 3-second hold-to-close button (`src/app/dashboard/booths/close-booth-control.tsx`), visual only, the real timing is a JS `setTimeout` — status colors) used across the app. `--card`/`--popover` were fixed to differ from `--background` in light mode after the Market Ochre rebrand had accidentally collapsed them to the same value (dark mode was already correct).
- `icon-192/`, `icon-512/` — PWA icon route folders (each renders a sized PNG, referenced by `manifest.ts`).
- `legal/` — public `terms/` + `privacy/` document pages (each a one-line Server Component rendering `@merqo/ui`'s `LegalDocument`), plus `accept/`, the interstitial the legal-acceptance gate (`requireCurrentLegalAcceptance`, `@/lib/legal-gate`) bounces a signed-in vendor to when their accepted terms/privacy versions are stale.
- `icon.tsx` — `Icon` route handler; renders `brandIcon(32)` as a 32×32 PNG favicon.
- `layout.tsx` — `RootLayout`. Loads `Fraunces`, `Hanken_Grotesk`, `Space_Mono` via `next/font/google`, sets `metadata`/`viewport` (PWA `appleWebApp`, `themeColor` from `BRAND_EMBER`). Fetches the single `platform_settings` row (`banner_enabled`/`banner_message`) via an anonymous-safe `createServerClient()` read, falling back to `DEFAULT_PLATFORM_SETTINGS` (`@/lib/platform-settings`) on error so a read failure never breaks every page load; renders `ServiceWorkerRegistrar` and `MaintenanceBanner` (the site-wide banner, toggled from `/admin`), and wraps `Providers`/children in next-themes' `ThemeProvider` (`attribute="class"`, `defaultTheme="system"`, `enableSystem`) so the manual Light/Dark/System control in `@merqo/ui`'s `AccountMenu` can toggle the `.dark` class in `globals.css`, replacing the previous hand-rolled OS-only `<Script>` toggle.
- `manifest.ts` — `manifest()` returns the `MetadataRoute.Manifest` (name, `display: "standalone"`, `background_color`/`theme_color` from `@/lib/brand-icon`, icon list pointing at `/icon-192`/`/icon-512`).
- `not-found.tsx` — `NotFound` component; branded 404 shown e.g. for a stale/mistyped order URL, links back to `/`.
- `o/` — short-code customer ordering entry point.
- `onboarding/` — post-signup vendor onboarding flow.
- `order/` — legacy booth-id-based customer ordering route.
- `page.tsx` — `LandingPage` async server component, the marketing home page. Fetches the signed-in user and the single `pricing` row via `createServerClient()`, falls back to `DEFAULT_PRICING` (from `@/lib/pricing`) when prices are unset (pre-Stripe beta framing). Renders hero, trust strip, `FeaturedBooths`, "how it works" steps, "why qkit" cards, a pricing teaser (Free / Event pass / Monthly Pro), two FAQ columns (`FAQ` for prospects, `VENDOR_FAQ` for signed-up vendors troubleshooting real product behavior — QR regeneration, stock caps, SGT-scheduled hours, rate limits, etc.), and `Footer` (`src/components/landing/footer.tsx`, own README). CTA target and label switch based on whether `user` is signed in.

## Connectivity

`(auth)/` is the vendor login/reset flow; `dashboard/` is the authenticated vendor area; `legal/` holds the public document pages and the acceptance interstitial the dashboard gate redirects to. `o/` and `order/` are the two customer-facing ordering surfaces (the current short-code entry point and the legacy booth-id route). `admin/` and `api/` are internal/ops surfaces; `actions/` holds server actions shared across routes rather than colocated with one page. `layout.tsx` is the ancestor of every route below; `page.tsx` (the landing page) is the only route directly under `app/` besides the special Next.js files.
