# display

## Purpose

Public, unauthenticated TV/second-screen queue display for one booth —
meant to run on a screen near the booth, not a customer's own phone. Answers
Manfred's second-event AAR pain point (item B, `docs/meta/2026-09-10-manfred-
second-aar-feature-backlog.md`): the "uncle" segment won't self-monitor a
phone, so the vendor marking an order "ready" on their own board needs to
show up somewhere a customer glancing at a shared screen will actually
notice.

## Contents

- `actions.ts` — `getBoothQueueDisplay(boothId)`: service-client read of one
  booth's active (non-terminal) orders, shaped down to
  `{ orderNumber, displayNumber, status }` — no customer name/phone/payment/
  items, the least a screen visible to anyone near the booth needs. No
  per-viewer secret to check (unlike the token-gated
  `../[orderNumber]/status-actions.ts`): this screen is meant to be readable
  by anyone near the booth, so `booth_id` alone is the read key — the same
  trade `getWaitEstimate` already makes internally, just reached here with
  no token-gated entry point in front of it. Computes the daily-reset
  display number the same way `../[orderNumber]/page.tsx`'s
  `resolveHeadingNumber` does (one extra query for the booth's first order
  of the SGT day, only when `board_settings.daily_order_number_reset` is
  on), and sorts with the same priority-bump-then-oldest-first rule as
  `sortActiveOrders` (`@/lib/orders`), reimplemented locally against this
  query's narrower row shape rather than imported. Returns `null` (not `[]`)
  on a real read failure, so the poller can tell "booth has no active
  orders" apart from "the read broke" and keep showing the last good state
  either way.
- `actions.test.ts` — unit tests (mocked Supabase chains) for the booth-
  not-found/booth-read-error/orders-read-error null returns, the
  priority-bump sort, and the daily-reset display-number computation.
- `page.tsx` — `BoothQueueDisplayPage` (route entry, `revalidate=0`):
  validates `boothId` as a UUID (`notFound()` otherwise, same as
  `../page.tsx`), confirms the booth exists (service client — anon can't
  read `booths` directly, see `../README.md`), then renders `QueueDisplay`
  seeded with `getBoothQueueDisplay`'s initial snapshot (`[]` on a read
  failure, so a transient DB hiccup at page-load never breaks the screen
  outright — the client poller gets its own chance to recover).
- `page.dom.test.tsx` — RTL test rendering `BoothQueueDisplayPage` directly
  (same pattern as `../[orderNumber]/page.dom.test.tsx`), `QueueDisplay`
  stubbed out (own dedicated test file): the notFound branches for an
  invalid boothId and a missing booth, and that a real booth's name/id/
  initial orders reach `QueueDisplay` as props.
- `queue-display.tsx` — `QueueDisplay({ boothId, boothName, initialOrders })`
  client component: polls `getBoothQueueDisplay` every 5s (`usePolling`,
  same 5s cadence as `../[orderNumber]/order-status-poller.tsx` — no
  realtime here either, same rationale). Diffs each poll against the
  previous status snapshot (seeded from `initialOrders` on mount, so
  orders already `ready` before the page loaded never falsely flash).
  Forces the app's own `.dark` theme on this page regardless of the
  viewing device's OS setting — a genuine digital-signage board reads
  better on a dark ground with bright accents than a light one, and the
  choice follows from the use scene (a TV/kiosk screen at a market or
  event, day or night), not the visitor's own preference.

  A `ready` order carries a **freshness** cue, not just a one-shot flash:
  it's a solid, bright `bg-primary` fill (the app's own warm accent, not
  a status/semantic color) for `FRESH_MS` (5 minutes) after it first went
  ready, then eases (`transition-colors duration-700`) into a muted
  `bg-primary/10` tint — a rough "is this still hot" proxy so a glance at
  the Ready column tells a customer or vendor which numbers just got
  called versus which have been sitting a while. `readyAt` (a
  `Map<orderNumber, timestamp>`, React state) records when each currently
  -ready order first transitioned, seeded empty on mount so an order
  already `ready` in `initialOrders` has no entry and renders aged from
  the start (matches the old "no false flash on load" behavior); `nowMs`
  (also state, ticked every 30s by its own effect, same
  seed-null-then-`useEffect` pattern as
  `../[orderNumber]/order-status-poller.tsx`'s own `nowMs`) supplies the
  "now" side of the age math — both are plain state rather than refs
  because render must stay pure (no reading a ref or calling `Date.now()`
  directly in the render body; the `react-hooks/purity`/`react-hooks/refs`
  lint rules catch this). On top of that, the moment an order first
  transitions it also gets a brief one-time "stamped" entrance (tilts
  `-rotate-3`, `fade-rise`) for `FLASH_MS` (3.5s) — the same reveal the
  customer's own status page already uses for its "Ready" moment
  (`order-status-poller.tsx`'s `status === "ready"` block) — layered on
  top of, not instead of, the freshness fill. Preparing tiles stay a
  quiet, uncolored card throughout — the Ready/Preparing contrast is the
  entire point, so only Ready ever carries color. A still-fresh order
  also sorts to the front of the Ready grid (ahead of the cap-visibility
  logic below), landing in the same first/most-noticeable slot a physical
  "now serving" board gives its latest number. Sound is opt-in and
  separate from the visual cue on purpose: `playReadyChime`
  (`@/lib/order-alerts`) uses the Web Audio API, which browsers keep
  suspended until a user gesture unlocks it — a TV tab nobody touches
  would never unlock it, so a chime call before that gesture would
  silently never play. An "Enable sound" button (shown until tapped)
  calls the shared `unlockAudio()` export once, meant to be tapped by the
  vendor when they set the screen up; if it's never tapped, the display
  still works fully via the visual cue alone. Preparing and Ready for
  pickup render side by side (`grid-cols-2` from `sm:` up, stacked below
  it, a dashed vertical rule between them echoing the perforation motif
  used elsewhere in this app) rather than stacked full-width, so a long
  Preparing list can't push Ready off the bottom. The whole page is
  `h-screen overflow-hidden` — a TV screen has no scroll — so each column
  also caps how many tiles it ever renders
  (`MAX_VISIBLE_PREPARING`/`MAX_VISIBLE_READY`, fixed numbers tuned for a
  landscape screen rather than measured against the real viewport) and
  shows a "+N more" line for whatever's hidden past the cap, dropping the
  newest orders first (the ones a customer's been waiting on longest stay
  visible). A still-fresh order is never one of the hidden ones, even
  past the cap — freshness is the entire point of this screen, so it
  always gets a guaranteed slot ahead of older, already-aged ready orders
  competing for the same limited space.

- `queue-display.dom.test.tsx` — RTL tests for the Preparing/Ready
  grouping, each group's own empty state, that a poll updates the
  rendered orders, that a genuine ready-transition gets both the
  `fade-rise` stamp class and the solid fresh-fill class while an order
  already ready on mount renders aged/muted from the start, the
  silent-by-default chime behavior, the "Enable sound" button's own click
  effect, a transient poll failure (`getBoothQueueDisplay` returning
  `null`) keeping the last good state instead of clearing the screen,
  each column's own render cap plus its "+N more" line, and that a
  still-fresh order still renders even when the ready count is already
  past the cap.

## Connectivity

Linked to from `src/app/dashboard/booths/booth-list.tsx`'s "Open TV
display" button (`/order/{boothId}/display`, opened in a new tab) — not
reachable from anything in the customer order flow, and carries no token.
`queue-display.tsx` polls `actions.ts`'s `getBoothQueueDisplay`, the same
service-client-bypasses-RLS pattern `../[orderNumber]/status-actions.ts`
uses, just without a per-order secret gating it.
