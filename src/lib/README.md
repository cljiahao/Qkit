# lib

## Purpose

Business rules, validation, database types and server/browser integration helpers
for qkit. Pure helpers accept data and clocks from callers and can be tested
without a DOM or database. Browser alerts, React icon rendering, Supabase clients
and cross-kit HTTP/RPC adapters retain their own platform dependencies.

## Contents

- `action-result.ts` — `ActionResult<T>` discriminated union
  (`{success:true}&T | {success:false,error}`) returned by every Server Action.
- `admin-stats.ts` — `activationFunnel` (signed-up → booth → order → Pro,
  distinct-vendor counts), `latestActivePassByVendor` (per-vendor live-license
  expiry map), `summarizeVendors`/`summarizeEvents` (plan/signup and event-type
  rollups) for the `/admin` overview.
- `admin-stats.test.ts` — unit tests for the above four aggregation functions.
- `admin-vendor-health.ts` — `vendorStatus`/`buildVendorHealth`: classifies each
  vendor into a banded `VendorStatus` (`attention`/`expiring`/`stuck`/`quiet`/
  `new`/`healthy`, first-match-wins) plus `statusRank` (triage sort key) and
  `passHoursLeft`; deliberately not a synthetic numeric score.
- `admin-vendor-health.test.ts` — tests status classification rules and the
  health-map rollup.
- `admin-vendor-names.ts` — `vendorStallNames(supabase, vendorIds)`: resolves
  each vendor id's stall name from `merqo.vendor_profile` (via
  `getOrCreateVendorProfile`), one RPC per unique id run in parallel —
  admin-only, low-traffic call sites, no batch-read RPC exists on the merqo
  side.
- `admin-vendor-names.test.ts` — tests parallel resolution, dedup of repeated
  ids into a single call each, and the empty-list no-op.
- `admin.ts` — `isAdmin(userId)` (row-presence check against the `admins`
  table) and `requireAdmin()`, the `/admin` route/action gate that 404s (not
  403s, to avoid revealing the route) signed-out or non-admin users.
- `admin.test.ts` — tests the admin gate's 404-on-unauthorized behavior.
- `allergen-icons.ts` — `ALLERGEN_ICONS: Record<AllergenTag, string>`, an
  emoji per `ALLERGEN_TAGS` value. Moved here 2026-09-01 (was
  `dashboard/booths/allergen-icons.ts`) once the customer-facing
  `components/allergen-badges.tsx`/`item-customizer.tsx` needed the same
  icon set — a shared `lib/` module rather than a dashboard-scoped one
  reaching across into `components/`. Rendering-only, no schema/data-model
  change.
- `booth-access.ts` — `servableBoothIds`/`isBoothPaused`: which of a vendor's
  active booths are customer-servable under their entitlement (unlimited plans
  serve all; free serves only the oldest `maxBooths`), mirroring the
  `booth_servable` SQL function so DB and dashboard agree.
- `booth-access.test.ts` — tests serveability under free vs. unlimited
  entitlements and the "paused" classification.
- `booth-code.ts` — `orderPath(code)`: builds the `/o/{code}` customer entry
  URL from a booth's short code.
- `booth-code.test.ts` — tests URL encoding of the order path.
- `booth-color.ts` — `boothColor(boothId)`: deterministic hash into an 8-color
  oklch palette (`BOOTH_COLORS`) so a booth's accent dot is stable without a DB
  column.
- `booth-color.test.ts` — tests hash stability/distribution.
- `booth-images.ts` — `boothImagePaths`, `orphanedImagePaths`: extract
  in-bucket storage paths from booth-images public URLs and diff before/after
  booth state to find storage objects safe to delete after an image swap or
  booth deletion. URL-to-path parsing is `@merqo/ui`'s shared
  `storagePathFromPublicUrl` (this file carried its own copy until
  2026-09-22); the shared one also rejects a path with an empty segment.
  `uploadedPaths(urls)` maps any other URLs (avatar, paykit QR) to paths the
  same way, and `unsavedUploadPaths(folder, objects, referenced, nowMs,
graceMs)` picks the objects in a vendor folder that nothing references and
  that are older than `UNSAVED_UPLOAD_GRACE_MS` (24h): uploads from a form the
  vendor never saved. Used by `dashboard/booths/sweep-unsaved-uploads.ts`.
- `booth-images.test.ts` — tests path extraction, orphan-path diffing, and the
  unsaved-upload selection (grace boundary, referenced objects kept, folders
  and bad timestamps skipped).
- `brand-icon.tsx` — `brandIcon(size)` React element plus `BRAND_EMBER`/
  `BRAND_OAT` color constants; renders the "Q" app mark for `ImageResponse`-
  generated favicon/manifest/apple-touch icons.
- `carousel.ts` — `nearestIndex(scrollLeft, boardWidth, count)`: clamped
  nearest-board-index calculation for a horizontally-scrolling carousel.
- `carousel.test.ts` — tests clamping and the non-positive-width edge case.
- `availability.ts` — what a customer can still add to a basket, parsed from
  `booth_availability` (migration `0096`): `parseAvailability`, `hasLimits`/
  `holdsApply`, `addBlock` + `addBlockMessage` (why one more of an item cannot
  go in: the item's stock, the booth's daily total, or the per-order limit,
  each told apart from "held in another basket"), and `fitCart` (cuts a basket
  to what is available, trimming from the end). Display and courtesy only;
  `place_order` and the cap triggers are the real limits.
- `availability.test.ts` — tests parsing, each block reason and its order of
  precedence, the messages, and trimming.
- `cart-storage.ts` — `saveCart`/`loadCart`/`clearCart`: persists the
  in-progress customer cart to `sessionStorage` (keyed `qkit:cart:{boothId}`)
  as compact `ReorderLine`s, validated on read via `isValidLine`; best-effort
  (silently no-ops without `window` or on quota/private-mode errors).
  `holdSessionId(boothId)` is the random id the tab's basket holds stock under
  (`qkit:hold:{boothId}`), kept across a refresh so a customer never sees
  their own held items as someone else's.
- `cart-storage.test.ts` — tests save/load/clear round-tripping and malformed
  or missing storage.
- `pending-order.ts` — per-booth session replay key and canonical SHA-256 payload
  digest for recovering uncertain orders after reload, without plaintext customer
  details. Storage access failures are distinguished from corrupt metadata so
  initial ordering remains available with a keep-page-open warning.
- `pending-order.test.ts` — recovery metadata isolation, payload normalization,
  corrupt data rejection and unavailable storage regressions.
- `daily-order-number.ts` — `firstOrderNumberToday(client, boothId)`: the
  booth's first `order_number` of the SGT day, the baseline
  `displayOrderNumber` ranks against. `vendorFacingOrderNumber(client,
vendorId, boothId, orderNumber)`: the day's rank when the vendor has daily
  numbering on, the permanent number otherwise. One query for every server
  path that shows a single booth's ticket number (status page, TV display,
  printed label, Telegram alert), which each used to carry their own copy.
  The order board reads many booths at once and keeps its own query.
- `daily-order-number.test.ts` — the first order found, none today, the SGT
  day window, and `vendorFacingOrderNumber` with daily numbering on, off,
  unreadable settings, and no order yet today.
- `cart.ts` — `cartKey(menuItemId, options)` (stable dedup key sorted by
  option group so selection order doesn't matter) and `cartTotal`.
- `cart.test.ts` — tests cart-key stability and total summation.
- `env.ts` — `publicEnv`: fail-fast validated `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, client-safe (no secrets), read via
  literal `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` so Next.js still inlines them at build.
- `events.ts` — `eventLabel(license)`: display name for a paid pass/event
  (vendor's own label, or a dated default like "Pass · 7 Jun").
- `events.test.ts` — tests label fallback and whitespace-only-label handling.
- `hash.ts` — `hashBuffer(buffer)`: SHA-256 hex digest of an `ArrayBuffer` via
  `node:crypto`'s `createHash` (matches this repo's existing hashing
  convention, not the global Web Crypto `crypto.subtle`). Used by
  `claimPayment` (`order/[boothId]/[orderNumber]/payment-actions.ts`) to
  fingerprint an uploaded payment-proof photo (`orders.payment_proof_hash`).
- `hash.test.ts` — tests digest stability and that different input hashes
  differently.
- `hours-editor.ts` — pure state transitions behind the working-hours editor:
  `WEEKDAY_KEYS`, `DEFAULT_WINDOW`, `emptyWeek`, `dailyHours`, `weekFromDaily`,
  `dailyFromWeek` — the daily↔weekly conversions, kept out of the component so
  they're unit-testable without a DOM.
- `hours-editor.test.ts` — tests the daily/weekly conversion helpers.
- `hours.ts` — `BoothHours`/`DayWindow` types and `isBoothOpen`/
  `nextOpenLabel`: SGT wall-clock open/closed logic including overnight
  windows (`eveningCovers`/`morningCarry` carry a Fri 22:00–02:00 shift past
  midnight).
- `hours.test.ts` — tests daily/weekly/overnight open-closed logic and the
  "Opens …" label.
- `image-upload-adapter.ts` — `uploadQkitImage`: `@merqo/ui`'s `ImageUploader`
  `onUpload` backend — writes the already-resized blob to the `booth-images`
  Supabase Storage bucket at the path the component built
  (`${pathPrefix}/${uuid}.${ext}`, `pathPrefix` set to the vendor id at each
  call site) and resolves the public URL; throws on a storage error so
  `ImageUploader` surfaces it via its own `onError`. A plain function, not a
  factory — every call site's vendor id is already baked into `path` by the
  time `onUpload` runs, so there's nothing left to close over.
- `image-upload-adapter.test.ts` — tests a successful upload/public-URL
  round trip and that a storage error propagates as a rejection.
- `legal-gate.ts` — `checkLegalAcceptance(email)` and its guard companion
  `requireCurrentLegalAcceptance(email)`. qkit owns no legal-acceptance
  record (merqo does), so checking currency is a bearer-authed
  `GET /api/merqo/legal-status` call, its result compared against
  `@merqo/ui`'s `LEGAL_VERSIONS` via `isLegalCurrent` and cached in the
  `legal_check_state` TTL table (5 min) — the same throttle pattern as
  merqo's `vendor_sync_state`, since the check runs on every gated dashboard
  render. **Fails closed**: a missing `MERQO_CUSTOMER_SECRET`, an unreachable
  merqo, a non-2xx, or a malformed body all resolve to "not current", which
  `requireCurrentLegalAcceptance` turns into a `redirect("/legal/accept")`.
  Wired into `requireVendor`/`requireEntitledVendor` (`supabase/`) and
  `dashboard/layout.tsx`.
- `legal-gate.test.ts` — covers the TTL cache short-circuit (no fetch within
  the window), the re-check-and-cache path, a stale/out-of-date accepted
  version, and every fail-closed branch (network error, non-2xx, missing
  secret).
- `menu-csv.ts` — `menuItemsToCsv(items)`/`csvToMenuItems(text)`/
  `optionGroupsFromCsvChoices(choices)`: the qkit-side of the menu-manager's
  CSV bulk export/import, 10 fixed columns —
  `name,description,price,cost,available,group_name,group_type,choice_label,choice_price,choice_code`
  (`choice_code` is the choice's short code on the order ticket, at most
  `OPTION_CODE_MAX` characters; it is last so a file exported before it
  existed still imports unchanged, and a blank cell leaves the choice printing
  in full)
  (`cost` added 2026-09-01, the item's own private `cost_cents`; the last 4
  customization columns added the same day; dollars not cents for
  spreadsheet readability; choice-level cost delta and allergens are
  deliberately excluded — both live behind "Advanced" in
  `option-groups-editor.tsx`, out of CSV scope per the design doc). A hand-
  rolled RFC4180-shaped encode/decode (quoted fields, embedded commas/
  quotes) rather than a new dependency; preserves LF, CRLF and CR newlines
  inside quoted fields. An item row has `name` filled; a choice row has
  `name` blank and `group_name`/`choice_label` filled, attached to the item
  row immediately above it (continuation rows) — consecutive choice rows
  sharing a `group_name` form one group, a `group_name` change starts a
  new group under the same item. `csvToMenuItems` always treats the first
  line as the header (skipped) and returns one `CsvMenuRow` (with a nested
  `choices: CsvChoiceRow[]`) per item row, via the shared `parseDollarField`
  helper (blank is valid/unset, negative or non-numeric is an error instead
  of a silent drop) for `price`/`cost`/`choice_price`. Every error string
  embeds its own real spreadsheet row number (header = row 1), computed
  once here rather than by the UI, so nesting choice rows under their item
  doesn't break a flat array-index-based row number. `optionGroupsFromCsvChoices`
  turns a flat `CsvChoiceRow[]` (errored rows skipped) into `OptionGroup[]`
  with fresh ids — `menu-manager.tsx`'s `commitImport` calls it only when a
  row has at least one valid choice, otherwise leaving a name-matched
  existing item's `option_groups` untouched. `menuCsvTemplate()` returns
  the same header plus two example item rows (one with a blank price and
  cost, one with both set), no example customization rows — a vendor with
  no items yet had no way to see the expected column format before this,
  since `menuItemsToCsv([])` is just a bare header line with nothing to
  copy from.
- `menu-csv.test.ts` — round-trip encode/decode (including a
  comma-containing description through the quoting path, cost alongside
  price, and continuation rows for a group's choices), header skipping,
  missing-name/invalid-or-negative-price/invalid-or-negative-cost row
  errors, blank-price-or-cost-is-not-an-error, the `available` default
  (true unless the cell is exactly `false`), empty/header-only input,
  choice-row attachment/grouping (consecutive same-`group_name` rows,
  a `group_name` change starting a new group, `group_type` any/one,
  missing-group-or-item-above errors, invalid choice price), and
  `optionGroupsFromCsvChoices`'s grouping/multiple-mapping/errored-row-
  skipping/fresh-id behavior. Confirms `menuCsvTemplate()`'s own output
  round-trips through `csvToMenuItems` with no error rows and no example
  customization rows.
- `menu-sections.ts` — `groupByCategory(items, categories)`: pure grouping
  of a booth's `menu_items` under its `menu_categories` (booth's own order),
  bucketing any missing/unmatched category id into "Other", always last, and
  dropping empty sections — used by `OrderForm` to render the customer menu
  grouped once a booth has 2+ non-empty sections. Both inputs were schema/
  type-only with no vendor UI to actually populate them until
  `dashboard/booths/menu-editor.tsx`'s section management/picker shipped
  (2026-09-02) — this function itself is unchanged.
- `menu-sections.test.ts` — tests category-order grouping, the Other bucket,
  empty-section dropping, and the no-categories-defined case.
- `merqo-auth.ts` — `bearerOk`/`provisionBearerOk`: constant-time bearer-token
  checks against `MERQO_METRICS_SECRET`/`MERQO_PROVISION_SECRET` respectively
  — deliberately separate secrets, since leaking the routine metrics-polling
  one must not also grant the tenant-provisioning write. `listAllAuthUsers`
  reads every auth page and fails the lookup on any page error;
  `findAuthUserByEmail` resolves shared-auth accounts for cross-kit admin flows.
- `merqo-customer-notify.ts` — `mintCustomerConnectToken(vendorId, kitSlug,
notifyRef)`/`notifyCustomer(vendorId, notifyRef, message)`/
  `notifyVendor(vendorId, message)`: server-only HTTP client for merqo's
  `POST /api/merqo/customer-connect-token`/`POST /api/merqo/notify-customer`/
  `POST /api/merqo/notify-vendor` endpoints (bearer `MERQO_CUSTOMER_SECRET`,
  `AbortSignal.timeout(3000)`) — the first **kit → merqo** HTTP direction in
  this codebase (every other cross-kit call flows merqo → kit).
  `notifyVendor` is the Phase A2 replacement for qkit's own now-retired
  Telegram bot (`placeOrder`'s vendor order-alert call — see
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-vendor-telegram-connect-design.md`).
  All three fail closed: `mintCustomerConnectToken` Zod-validates the response
  and returns `null` on any non-2xx/timeout/network error or unexpected body,
  `notifyCustomer`/`notifyVendor` catch + log and never throw, same
  fail-closed philosophy as `fetchEarnConfig` in `earn-link.tsx`. All three
  share one `merqoFetch` helper for the bearer-auth/timeout mechanics.
- `merqo-customer-notify.test.ts` — tests the request body/header shape for
  all three calls and the fail-closed/never-throw behavior on non-2xx,
  timeout, and network-error cases.
- `merqo-downgrade-request.ts` — `resolveDowngradeOutcome(hasVendorRow,
currentPlan)`: pure decision (`not_found`/`already_free`/`downgrade`) for the
  admin downgrade-vendor action.
- `merqo-downgrade-request.test.ts` — tests the three outcome branches.
- `merqo-metrics.ts` — `computeMerqoMetrics`: qkit's own business metrics
  (revenue/GMV, active vendors, weekly order deltas, signups, plan mix,
  pending upgrade requests, activation funnel) built on top of
  `admin-stats.ts`'s `summarizeVendors`/`activationFunnel`.
- `merqo-metrics.test.ts` — tests the metrics aggregation against synthetic
  vendor/booth/order/payment fixtures.
- `merqo-support.ts` — `submitSupportMessage`: cross-schema RPC wrapper
  calling merqo's `submit_support_message` (`supabase.schema("merqo").rpc(...)`)
  so a vendor's Get-help message lands in the shared cross-kit
  `merqo.support_messages` inbox — qkit's own local `support_messages`
  table was dropped (migration `0073`) once every reader/writer converged.
  Also exports `MerqoSupportMessagesSchema`, the hand-written mirror of that
  table's row shape shared by every admin page/route that reads it (each
  narrows via its own `.select(...)` string rather than redeclaring the type).
- `merqo-upgrade-request.ts` — `resolveUpgradeOutcome(hasVendorRow,
hasPendingRequest)`: pure decision (`not_found`/`already_pending`/`create`)
  for the admin/vendor upgrade-to-Pro request flow.
- `merqo-upgrade-request.test.ts` — tests the three outcome branches.
- `merqo-vendor-activity.ts` — `computeVendorActivity(vendor, booths, orders,
passExpiresAt, hasOpenMessage, nowMs)`: pure aggregation behind `GET
/api/merqo/vendor-activity` — orders/revenue (30d) and booth counts, plus a
  `status` delegated to `admin-vendor-health.ts`'s `buildVendorHealth` so it
  matches the admin console's own triage rather than re-deriving it.
- `merqo-vendor-activity.test.ts` — tests the 30d order/revenue rollup, the
  zeroed-fresh-vendor case, and that an open message/expiring pass surface
  the same `attention`/`expiring` statuses the admin console shows.
- `merqo-vendor-profile.ts` — `getOrCreateVendorProfile`/`patchVendorProfile`:
  cross-schema helper calling merqo's `get_or_create_vendor_profile`/
  `patch_vendor_profile` RPCs (`supabase.schema("merqo").rpc(...)`) so
  stall name + social links read/write against the shared
  `merqo.vendor_profile` table instead of the stale `qkit.vendors` columns.
- `merqo-vendor-profile.test.ts` — tests the RPC call shape (schema/function
  name, args) and that a Postgres error surfaces as a thrown `Error` with the
  underlying message.
- `merqo-vendor-status.ts` — `resolveVendorStatus(email, authUsers, vendors)`:
  two-step email → auth user → vendor plan lookup (vendors has no email
  column) for admin vendor search.
- `merqo-vendor-status.test.ts` — tests the email-to-vendor resolution,
  including no-match cases.
- `nps.ts` — `npsBreakdown(scores)`: Net Promoter Score classification
  (promoters 9-10 / passives 7-8 / detractors 0-6) and the -100..100 score.
- `nps.test.ts` — tests the breakdown math and the empty-responses case.
- `order-alerts.ts` — customer/vendor "order ready"/"new order" alerting:
  `isNotifySupported`/`notifyPermission`/`requestNotifyPermission`,
  `fireReadyNotification`/`fireNewOrderNotification` (service-worker
  `showNotification` with a page-level `Notification` fallback),
  `unlockAudio` + `playReadyChime`/`playSound` (a shared, gesture-unlocked
  `AudioContext` playing one of five square-wave presets — chime/bell/ding/
  horn/triple — via WebAudio oscillators). Audio unlock failures are contained
  so browser restrictions cannot interrupt a customer or vendor gesture.
- `order-alerts.test.ts` — tests permission gating, notification dispatch
  fallback, sound-preset scheduling and synchronous/rejected audio-resume
  failures against mocked WebAudio/Notification APIs.
- `orders.ts` — order-board core: `BOARD_ORDER_COLUMNS` (explicit column list
  excluding `access_token`), `TERMINAL_STATUSES`/`isTerminal`, `ADVANCE` (legal
  forward-status map + button label), `orderAgeTone`/`elapsedMinutes`/
  `elapsedLabel` (minutes, then hours, then days past two days),
  `overtakenOrderIds(orders)` (ids of in-progress orders that a later order from
  the same booth has already overtaken, compared on `created_at` and scoped per
  booth: the board badges these, since an order nobody marked while later ones
  went out leaves its customer waiting on a screen that never changes),
  `buildAdvancePatch` (fulfillment status and timestamp patch, without payment
  writes), `sortActiveOrders` (vendor-board display sort,
  status-agnostic by design — a bumped order leads, then every order by
  `created_at`; takes an `AgeSortOrder`, `"earliest"` default or `"latest"`),
  `ordersAheadOf` (the separate, status-aware kitchen-priority queue used
  for the customer-facing wait estimate), `estimateLabel`/`estimateRangeLabel`
  (point vs. range "X-Y min" customer wait-estimate labels — the range form
  is what the order-status page actually renders, on the theory that an
  unmet precise promise erodes trust more than an upfront-honest range),
  `queuePositionLabel` (the no-time-data fallback, "N orders ahead of you"),
  `ORDER_STAGES` + `orderStageIndex` (the customer page's four stages, Received, Preparing, Ready, Collected; Ready and Collected are separate so a collected order never reads as one still waiting, pending and confirmed both sit on Received, and a cancelled order is off the track at -1), `displayOrderNumber`
  (board_settings.daily_order_number_reset's display-only "position among
  today's orders" number — pure arithmetic on the immutable `order_number`/
  `created_at` relative to a caller-supplied baseline, never a live recount;
  zero-padded to 3 digits like a ticket counter ("003"), growing past that
  rather than truncating; falls back to the real number when there's no
  baseline, or when the rank would be non-positive because the order predates
  the baseline), `isStaleOrderView(createdAt, nowMs)` + `STALE_ORDER_VIEW_HOURS`
  (whether an order-status page is being viewed more than 12 hours after the
  order was placed, which is how a browser-restored URL from a repeat
  customer's earlier visit shows up; 12 hours rather than the SGT day boundary
  so a late-night order checked after midnight is not called stale),
  `needsPaymentReview(status, paymentStatus)` (pure: whether a
  still-`pending` order with an outstanding payment claim needs
  `OrderCard`'s merged "Mark paid & start" review action instead of separate
  confirm-payment/advance buttons — keyed on order state, not `order.source`,
  so a walk-up order gets it too), `splitTrailingDigit(orderNumber)` (pure
  string split into `{lead, last}` so a vendor's physical pickup-shelf-slot
  system, keyed off an order's last digit, can have that digit visually
  emphasized wherever the number is shown — `OrderCard`, the TV/queue
  display; `null` in, both fields empty out, for an order still awaiting a
  payment claim with no number assigned yet).
- `orders.test.ts` — tests status transitions, fulfillment-only patch-building,
  sorting, age/label formatting,
  `displayOrderNumber`'s baseline arithmetic, 3-digit padding/growth and
  real-number fallbacks, `splitTrailingDigit`'s lead/last split (including
  the single-character and `null` edge cases), and `needsPaymentReview`'s
  pending/payment-status matrix.
- `paykit/` — server-only HTTP client for paykit's `/api/v1/*` checkout API
  (vendor config upsert + full read-back, checkout create/claim/unclaim/
  confirm/status); see its own README. Replaced the local PayNow QR builder
  and payment-method adapter registry that used to live at `payments/`
  (deleted in the paykit cutover).
- `plan.test.ts` — tests entitlement resolution across plan/pass/pro
  combinations and the `canAdd*`/`canHaveOptionGroups` gates.
- `payment-marker.ts` — everything that reads or writes the `{kind}` marker
  on `booths.payment`: `paymentKindOf(data)` (the stored kind, or null),
  `expectsPayment(kind)` (false for null and for the reserved `stripe`), and
  `paymentMarker(kind)` (what to store for a booth saved with that kind).
  Three files each parsed the marker their own way before.
- `payment-marker.test.ts` — each kind read from a marker and from a full
  config, null for anything else, the stripe rule, and a round trip.
- `plan.ts` — `Entitlement`/`Tier` model (`FREE`/`PASS`/`PRO` presets),
  `getEntitlement` (resolves a vendor's effective entitlement from
  `plan`+license expiry), `normalizePlan`, `canAddBooth`, `canAddMenuItem`,
  `canHaveOptionGroups`.
- `platform-settings.ts` — `PlatformSettingsConfig` type and
  `DEFAULT_PLATFORM_SETTINGS` (banner off): the fail-safe fallback when the
  `platform_settings` row can't be read, so a read failure never shows a
  stale/wrong banner to every visitor.
- `printkit/` — server-only HTTP client for printkit's job-creation API
  (`createPrintJob`, the only endpoint today); see its own README. Unlike
  `paykit/`, an unset `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRINTKIT_URL` has no fallback host — it
  fails closed rather than guessing a deployment.
- `pricing.ts` — `PricingConfig` type and `DEFAULT_PRICING` (zeroed fallback
  when the `pricing` row is unreadable, e.g. pre-migration).
- `qkit-printkit-auth.ts` — `printkitCallbackBearerOk`: constant-time bearer
  check against `PRINTKIT_CALLBACK_SECRET` for `POST
/api/printkit/print-status` — a plain shared secret, no `kit_slug:` prefix
  (mirrors `merqo-auth.ts`'s `bearerOk`, not `paykit/client.ts`'s outbound
  `qkit:<secret>` convention), since printkit has exactly one caller
  registered for this endpoint.
- `qkit-printkit-auth.test.ts` — tests the unset-secret, missing-header,
  mismatched-secret, and matching-secret cases.
- `rate-limit.ts` — `clientIp(headers)` (best-effort, spoofable fairness key —
  not an authz signal) and `rateLimit(supabase, key, limit, windowSeconds)`,
  which calls the `check_rate_limit` RPC and fails OPEN (with a logged error)
  on limiter failure so a degraded limiter never blocks real customers.
- `rate-limit.test.ts` — tests the fail-open behavior and IP extraction.
- `realtime-orders.ts` — `parseRealtimeOrderEvent`/`applyRealtimeOrderEvent`:
  validates untrusted Supabase Realtime payloads via `orderRowSchema`, strips
  `access_token` before it reaches client state (Postgres replication
  broadcasts full rows regardless of REST column selection), and folds
  DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE events into the board's order list. INSERT and UPDATE upsert by id, recovering missed inserts and avoiding replay duplicates.
- `realtime-orders.test.ts` — tests payload validation (rejecting malformed
  events) and the fold logic for each event type.
- `recent-orders.ts` — `getRecentOrders`/`getRecentOrdersForBooth`/
  `addRecentOrder`: customer order history in `localStorage`
  (`qkit:recent-orders`, capped at 10), since unauthenticated customers have no
  server-side link between a device and its orders.
- `recent-orders.test.ts` — tests read/write validation, dedup-by-order, and
  the MAX-10 cap.
- `reorder-handoff.ts` — `stashReorder`/`takeReorder`/`isValidLine`: one-shot
  `sessionStorage` handoff (`qkit:reorder:{boothId}`) from the status page or
  recent-orders list back into the booth menu; read-once (cleared immediately
  on read).
- `reorder-handoff.test.ts` — tests stash/take round-tripping, one-shot
  consumption, and line validation.
- `reorder.ts` — `reconcileReorder(lines, menuItems, remaining)`: rebuilds a
  past order's lines against the CURRENT menu (fresh name/price), drops lines
  whose item/options no longer exist or that are out of stock, merges
  duplicates by `cartKey`, and clamps quantities to live remaining stock.
- `reorder.test.ts` — tests reconciliation against removed items, changed
  options, unavailable items, and stock-capped quantities.
- `reviews.ts` — `summarizeReviews`/`groupReviewsByBooth`: aggregates
  customer order-feedback rows into a per-vendor rating distribution, average,
  and recent-comments list, split per booth.
- `reviews.test.ts` — tests distribution/average math and per-booth grouping.
- `sales-summary.ts` — `SalesSummaryV1` (the FROZEN, versioned, snake_case
  external contract returned by `/api/v1/sales/summary`), `toSalesSummaryV1`
  (maps the internal `StatsSummary`), `salesSummaryToCsv`.
- `sales-summary.test.ts` — tests the v1 mapping and CSV serialization
  (including cell-quoting of values containing commas/quotes/newlines).
- `schemas.ts` — the Zod schema library for every form/action/JSONB boundary:
  `loginSchema`, `vendorSchema`, `menuItemFormSchema`/`menuItemSchema`,
  `optionGroupSchema`/`sanitizeOptionGroups`, `boothHoursSchema`/
  `parseBoothHours`, `paymentConfigSchema` (discriminated union over
  pointer/paynow/stripe with cross-field `.superRefine` rules — validates the
  vendor-submitted config before `dashboard/booths/actions.ts` forwards it to
  paykit; `booths.payment` itself now stores only a `{kind}` marker, so
  there's no longer a `parsePaymentConfig` DB-read counterpart), `placeOrderSchema`, `orderRowSchema`/
  `parseRealtimeOrderEvent`'s dependency, `parseOrderRef` (validates the
  boothId/orderNumber/token triple every customer order action receives),
  `parsePreClaimRef` (same shape minus `orderNumber`, for the pre-claim flow
  where a payment-required order has no number yet — `loadPreClaimContext`/
  `claimPayment` in `order/[boothId]/[orderNumber]/payment-actions.ts`),
  `feedbackSchema`, `supportMessageSchema`, `profileNameSchema`/
  `displayNameSchema`/`passwordChangeSchema`, `boardSettingsSchema` (now also
  `daily_order_number_reset: boolean` and `default_prep_minutes:
1-60|null`, migration 0062; `show_wait_estimate: boolean`, migration 0068;
  `customer_telegram_notify_enabled: z.boolean().default(true)`, 2026-08-16 —
  a vendor-side opt-out for `advanceOrder`'s customer Telegram "order ready"
  ping, `.default(true)` so every pre-existing `board_settings` row, which
  predates this key, keeps notifying exactly as before — no migration, this
  is a JSONB column key not a SQL column),
  `pricingFormSchema`/`grantPassSchema`,
  `parseMenuItems`/`parseOrderItems`, `menuCategorySchema`/
  `menuCategoriesSchema`/`parseMenuCategories` (booth's ordered
  `{id, label}` menu sections, edited through the menu manager). `boothFormSchema` also carries `walkup_default: z.boolean()
.default(false)` (migration 0080, event-mode setup — makes the live board
  auto-open walk-up order entry for that booth) alongside
  `requires_arrival_confirm`. `boothFormSchema` no longer carries
  `menu_items` (2026-09-01, the menu-manager split) — that column is now
  owned exclusively by `menuItemsInputSchema` (`z.array(menuItemFormSchema)`),
  the input schema for `dashboard/booths/actions.ts`'s new `saveMenuItems`,
  so `saveBooth` never reads or writes it and the two actions can't clobber
  each other with stale client state.
- `schemas.test.ts` — the largest test file in `lib/`: validates every schema
  above, including the payment-config cross-field rules (xor of UEN/mobile,
  pointer requiring a link or QR) and the tolerant vs. strict read/write
  boundary distinction.
- `stats.ts` — `computeStats(orders, topN)`: the core stats/margin engine —
  revenue, AOV, cancellation/refund/fulfilment rates, per-item revenue/cost/
  profit aggregation (`topItems`), hourly and day×hour (SGT) buckets,
  `optionBreakdown`, `grossMargin` (only computed when at least one item
  carries a cost); also `windowSeries`/`waitSeries` (bucketed trend/wait-time
  series), `avgWaitSeconds`, `peakThroughput`, `pctChange`,
  `estimateWaitSeconds` (recent-average × orders-ahead customer wait
  estimate, null below `minSample`; takes an optional
  `fallbackAvgSecondsPerOrder` — board_settings.default_prep_minutes × 60 —
  used only below that sample size, so a vendor's manual estimate never
  overrides real, trusted data), `currentPrepEstimate` (same threshold gate
  as `estimateWaitSeconds`, but returns the recent average in minutes plus
  the raw sample count/`minSample` instead of multiplying by orders-ahead —
  a vendor-facing "here's what's live right now" label for the Settings
  page, not part of any customer-facing wait calculation).
- `stats.test.ts` — tests bucketing, margin computation, refund detection,
  fulfilment-rate math, the trend/wait series against synthetic orders,
  `estimateWaitSeconds`'s fallback (used below the sample size, ignored once
  real data meets it, null when neither is available), and
  `currentPrepEstimate`'s below/at/custom-sample-size cases and its
  sample-met-but-no-usable-wait-data null case.
- `stock.ts` — `parseRemaining`/`remainingFor`: parses the
  `booth_remaining_stock` JSONB RPC result into a typed per-item remaining-
  count map (Postgres is authoritative; this just reports it to the cart UI).
- `stock.test.ts` — tests parsing of malformed/partial remaining-stock data.
- `stuck-orders.ts` — `statusSinceByOrder(orders, events)`: maps each order to
  when it entered its CURRENT status — the latest matching
  `order_status_events` row's `created_at` (migration 0078), or the order's
  own `created_at` when there's no event yet (an order that's never
  advanced past its initial placement, or a stale/mismatched latest event —
  `recordOrderStatusEvent`, `src/lib/audit.ts`, is best-effort and can
  silently fail). `findStuckOrders(orders, nowMs)`: non-terminal orders
  (`@/lib/orders`'s `isTerminal`) sitting past `STUCK_THRESHOLD_MS` (30 min)
  in their current status, longest-stuck first — the `/admin` overview's
  "Stuck orders" stat + list (`admin/stuck-orders-section.tsx`).
- `stuck-orders.test.ts` — tests the events-vs-created_at fallback
  (no events, a matching latest event, a mismatched/stale latest event, and
  events belonging to other orders) and threshold/terminal-status flagging
  across all four non-terminal statuses plus sort order.
- `supabase/` — the three Supabase client factories (browser/server/service-
  role) plus entitlement/user/vendor read helpers; see its own README.
- `types.ts` — the hand-maintained mirror of the `qkit` Postgres schema: core
  domain types (`OrderStatus`, `OrderSource` — `"qr"` | `"walkup"`, migration
  0060 — `Plan`, `PaymentConfig`, `MenuItem`, `CartItem`,
  `OrderItem`, `BoardSettings`/`DEFAULT_BOARD_SETTINGS` — now also
  `daily_order_number_reset`/`default_prep_minutes`, migration 0062), and the
  full `Database["qkit"]` `Tables`/`Functions`/`Enums` shape (vendors, admins,
  admin_audit, events, licenses, payments, pricing, feedback,
  purchase_requests, booths — now also `walkup_default:
boolean`, migration 0080 — orders, booth_item_sold —
  `vendor_telegram`/`telegram_link_tokens` from migration 0076 were dropped
  again in migration 0077, Phase A2's retirement of qkit's own Telegram bot;
  RPCs
  `next_order_number`, `booth_remaining_stock`, `booth_servable`,
  `check_rate_limit`, `place_order`, `place_walkup_order` (now with `p_paid`,
  migration 0061), `get_booth_for_order`, `regenerate_short_code`,
  `submit_feedback`, `set_license_label`, `gen_short_code`) plus derived
  row-type aliases (`Vendor`, `Booth`, `Order`, `BoardOrder` = `Order` minus
  `access_token`, `License`, `Pricing`, `Payment`, `Feedback`, `Admin`,
  `AdminAudit`). Must be kept in sync with `supabase/migrations/` by hand (or
  via `supabase gen types typescript`).
- `tour-ids.ts` — `TOUR_IDS`/`TourId`/`tourIdSchema`: the allowlist for
  dashboard tourIds, kept in its own zero-React module rather than
  `@/components/tour-steps` (which pulls in `react-dom/server` for the
  orders tour's example badge markup) since `tour-actions.ts`'s
  `markTourSeen` — a `"use server"` action, a real HTTP endpoint callable
  with any argument regardless of what the UI sends — needs to `safeParse`
  a caller's `tourId` before ever using it as an object key. An unvalidated
  version let a caller inject an arbitrary key into `vendors.tours_seen`
  (a real CodeQL finding: remote property injection).
- `tour-ids.test.ts` — asserts every `TOUR_IDS` entry parses and an
  arbitrary string (including `"__proto__"`) is rejected.
- `ticket.ts` — what the order ticket prints, kept pure so it is unit-tested
  apart from the card: `buildOptionCodes(menuItems)` (a booth's short codes
  keyed by item, group and choice label, since an order stores labels),
  `ticketOptions(item, codes)` (code where set, full choice otherwise, group
  prefixed when two would read the same), `suggestOptionCode(label)`
  (initials, offered as a placeholder and never applied), and
  `ticketAttention(...)` (the single most urgent flag for a ticket, or
  null). `OPTION_CODE_MAX` bounds a code's length.
- `tz.ts` — Singapore-only wall-clock helpers built on cached
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instances: `sgtHour`/`sgtMinutes`/`sgtWeekday`,
  `WEEKDAY_ORDER`/`WEEKDAY_LABELS`, display formatters `shortDay`/
  `sgtClock`/`sgtWeekdayTime`/`shortDateTime`, and `sgtStartOfDayIso` (the UTC
  instant for SGT midnight of a given moment — the query boundary for
  "today" in SGT, e.g. the daily order-number reset baseline and the
  completed-orders page's default "Today" filter) — always formats/computes
  in `Asia/Singapore`, never server UTC or the browser's tz, to stay
  hydration-safe.
- `tz.test.ts` — tests hour/weekday extraction, each display formatter
  against fixed ISO instants, and `sgtStartOfDayIso`'s day-boundary rollover.
- `utils.ts` — `cn` (clsx + tailwind-merge), shared form style constants
  (`FORM_LABEL_CLASS`, `FORM_ERROR_CLASS`), `MS_PER_HOUR`/`MS_PER_DAY`,
  `formatPrice`, `centsToDollarString`, `parseDollarsToCents` (keystroke-level
  validation for money inputs), `orderHasPricing`, `count` (pluralized noun),
  `formatOptions`, `menuItemActionLabel` (a menu item's add/customize button
  label — sold out / customize / add — shared by the customer order form and
  the vendor's walk-up order dialog).
- `utils.test.ts` — tests price formatting, dollar-string parsing edge cases,
  and pluralization.

## Connectivity

`supabase/` provides the client factories (`createClient`/`createServerClient`/
`createServiceClient`) that every Server Action, Route Handler, and Server
Component in `src/app/` depends on for data access; `paykit/` provides the
HTTP client the customer checkout flow (order-status `page.tsx`,
`payment-actions.ts`) and the vendor "quick add PayNow" form
(`dashboard/booths/actions.ts`) both call through. Pure helpers are unit-tested directly. Browser and server adapters use mocked
platform-boundary tests; Stryker covers its configured subset of `src/lib`, not
every module listed here.
`types.ts` is the DB type mirror imported almost everywhere for row shapes;
`schemas.ts` is the Zod boundary imported by every Server Action and form in
`src/app/` plus by `realtime-orders.ts` (which validates untrusted Realtime
payloads via `orderRowSchema`) and `reorder-handoff.ts`/`cart-storage.ts`
(which validate `sessionStorage` reads via `isValidLine`). `orders.ts`'s
`BOARD_ORDER_COLUMNS` is shared between the dashboard's server query and
`src/hooks/use-realtime-orders.ts`'s resync query so both stay in sync.
`stats.ts` feeds `sales-summary.ts` (the frozen `/api/v1/sales/summary`
contract) and the admin/vendor stats dashboards. `stuck-orders.ts` feeds the
`/admin` overview's "Stuck orders" stat + `StuckOrdersSection` list. `plan.ts`'s `Entitlement`
feeds `booth-access.ts`'s serveability calculation, mirroring the
`booth_servable` SQL function in `supabase/migrations/`.

## Payment proof schema

`schemas.ts` exports `paymentProofSchema`, `PAYMENT_PROOF_MAX_BYTES` (1 MB) and `PAYMENT_PROOF_EXTENSIONS` (MIME type to file extension, JPEG/PNG/WebP). `claimPayment` and `pay-form.tsx` both validate against it, and the `payment-proofs` bucket enforces the same limits at the storage layer (migration `0093`). Keep all three in step.

## Shared package note

`safe-redirect.ts` and `image-resize.ts` moved to `@merqo/ui` (v0.31.0) — both were duplicated across all five repos. Import `safeRedirectPath` and `resizeToWebp` from `@merqo/ui` instead. `image-upload-adapter.ts` stays local: the Storage bucket and object path are qkit's own.

## Replaced-avatar cleanup

`image-upload-adapter.ts` also exports `removeReplacedAvatar(url)`, a best-effort delete of an avatar image that is no longer referenced. `ImageUploader` writes every upload under a fresh random name, so without it each avatar change left the previous image in storage forever. It checks every public avatar bucket (`booth-images`, `vendor-images`, `vendor-avatars`), because all five Merqo apps share one signed-in user and so one `avatar_url`, which may have been set from any of them. It uses `@merqo/ui`'s `storagePathFromPublicUrl`, so an OAuth provider picture (a Google profile photo) is never treated as ours to delete, and it never throws. Each bucket's owner-folder DELETE policy still bounds what a vendor can remove.

## Deferred-upload cleanup

The booth banner, menu photo and payment QR uploaders run in `@merqo/ui`'s
`deferUpload` mode, so an image reaches storage only when its form saves.
Two helpers delete what a failed save uploaded:
`removeUnsavedImages(urls)` in `image-upload-adapter.ts` is the browser-side,
best-effort delete for failures before anything is written, and
`failedSaveUploadPaths(urls, vendorId, persisted)` in `booth-images.ts` is the
pure filter `saveBooth` uses server-side. The filter only ever returns
booth-images objects in the vendor's own folder, since the list comes from
the client, and skips anything in `persisted`.

## Review corrections (2026-10-07)

Menu CSV records preserve quoted LF, CRLF, and CR newlines on export/import.
Option statistics key group and choice as a tuple so different pairs cannot collide.
Restored carts recompute current option surcharges, including options on unpriced items.
