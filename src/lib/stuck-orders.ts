 * revertOrderAdvance/cancelOrder/sweepReadyOrders (src/app/dashboard/
 * order-actions.ts) — placement itself (place_order/place_walkup_order, SQL)
 * writes no row, so an order that's never advanced has no event at all and
 * has been in its current ("pending") status since order.created_at. When
 * events exist, the latest one's created_at is the current status's start
 * time, but only when its to_status still matches the order's live status —
 * recordOrderStatusEvent (src/lib/audit.ts) is best-effort and can silently
 * fail, so a stale/mismatched latest event is untrustworthy and falls back
 * to created_at too (safer to over-flag a possibly-stuck order on bad data
 * than to hide a real one behind it). Pure.
