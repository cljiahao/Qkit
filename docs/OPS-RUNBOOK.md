# qkit — Operations Runbook

Symptom-level triage for live-event issues. For a bad app deploy or a bad
migration specifically, see `ROLLBACK.md` instead — this doc is about
day-to-day operational symptoms, most of which need no code change at all.

## Self-serve, no dev needed

| Symptom                                                        | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A vendor's order is stuck in one status                        | The **vendor** advances/cancels it from their own dashboard board — this is normal vendor self-service, not an admin action. If they say they can't, check they're signed in as the right vendor. |
| Whole site / a booth page 500s right after a deploy            | Vercel dashboard → Deployments → find the last known-good one → "..." → **Promote to Production**. Instant, no rebuild. See `ROLLBACK.md`.                                                        |
| Customer says login redirects to `/login?error=oauth`          | They're on a preview (`*.vercel.app`) link, not `qkit.merqo.io`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is Production-only by design (2026-08-13 incident) — send them the real domain.                 |
| Need to comp/extend a vendor's pass, resolve a support message | Already self-serve at `qkit.merqo.io/admin` — vendor detail page has Grant pass / Downgrade / Revoke; Feedback tab surfaces support messages.                                                     |
| Vendor asks to reconnect Telegram alerts                       | They reconnect once via merqo's own `/profile` page — old qkit-bot links don't carry over (Phase A2 migration, 2026-08-16), this is expected, not a bug.                                          |

## Check an env var before assuming a bug

These integrations **fail silently** by design — a missing/wrong secret looks
exactly like "the feature just doesn't fire," not an error. Before treating
any of these as a bug, check the var is set on Vercel → Production first:

| Reported symptom                            | Env var to check                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PayNow / checkout doesn't show for a booth  | `PAYKIT_KIT_SECRET`                                                           |
| Order never auto-prints                     | `PRINTKIT_KIT_SECRET`, `PRINTKIT_CALLBACK_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRINTKIT_URL` |
| No Telegram ping to vendor or customer      | `MERQO_CUSTOMER_SECRET`, `MERQO_BASE_URL`                                     |
| "Earn a stamp" link missing on order-status | `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOOPKIT_URL`                                                     |

## When it actually needs a dev (me)

- The env var above is confirmed set correctly and the feature still doesn't
  fire.
- A 500 that Promote-to-Production doesn't fix (points at a bad migration,
  not a bad deploy — see `ROLLBACK.md`'s DB section).
- Anything not covered above, or a genuinely new failure mode.

Hand over: exact error text, timestamp, vendor/booth name. Check
`qkit.merqo.io/admin`'s "Stuck Orders" tile and the vendor's "Last order"
timestamp first — both are visible without any dashboard login and narrow
down whether it's one vendor or the whole platform.
