# migrations

## Purpose

Append-only SQL history defining qkit tables, RLS policies, constrained RPCs,
triggers, indexes and Data API privileges. Apply migrations in filename order.
Correct an applied migration with a new migration rather than rewriting it.

Current ordering uses `place_order` for QR customers and `place_walkup_order`
for authenticated owners. Both reprice against stored menu choices; submitted
prices are informational. QR readers use the sanitized `get_booth_for_order`
projection. Anonymous/authenticated callers cannot directly insert orders.
Paid QR orders begin `pending` without a number; privileged payment handling
assigns a number. Print opt-in does not prove physical printer connectivity.

The latest forward corrections are:

- `0095_review_authorization_hardening.sql`: service-only order numbering and
  generic rate limiting, restricted vendor/booth INSERT columns, nested cost
  privacy, shared option validation, paid-order stock locking, bounded
  order-proof feedback and validated server-owned analytics. Missing optional
  shared metrics are skipped; installed integration errors still propagate.
- `0096_atomic_board_settings_patch.sql`: caller-scoped partial settings merge
  with strict keys, types and merged timing validation under a row lock.
- `0097_atomic_booth_creation_cap.sql`: owner-only statement triggers enforce
  the free booth cap across inserts and vendor reassignment. Sorted vendor
  locks and a fresh recount serialize competing writes; cap-enforced free
  writes require READ COMMITTED. Paid entitlements retain their existing rules.
- `0098_scoped_admin_membership.sql`: authenticated admin-membership checks are
  limited to the caller's subject, with privileged service lookups retained;
  anonymous and default PUBLIC execution are revoked.
- `0099_audit_truncate_privileges.sql`: service-role `TRUNCATE` is revoked on
  the existing audit trails while reads/appends and owner maintenance remain.

Column privileges and RLS work together. Revoking one column does not subtract
it from a table-level grant (`0042`); grant only editable columns. An omitted
UPDATE `WITH CHECK` uses the `USING` expression for new rows, so the explicit
checks in older migrations clarify policy intent rather than fixing an
implicit ownership-reassignment bypass.

## Connectivity

Apply through the Supabase CLI and the project's migration safety workflow.
Application deployment alone does not apply database permission corrections.
Keep [the TypeScript schema mirror](../../src/lib/types.ts) aligned with schema
changes; regenerate from a disposable database when available.

Shared deployments must apply the corresponding Merqo migrations before
profile/feedback/support backfills and their local-column/table retirement.
Existence guards allow isolated qkit development, but do not prove that a
shared production backfill ran or that deployment ordering was correct.
Qkit's retired bot requires vendors to authorize the shared Merqo bot; this
is a bot-authorization change, not evidence that private Telegram chat IDs
are numerically different between bots.

[Database regressions](../tests/README.md) exercise authorization, RPCs and
concurrency separately from mocked application tests. The current forward
fixtures have not been executed in this review because Docker Desktop's
Linux database engine is unavailable. [Seeds](../seed/README.md) are manual
fixtures with separate Paykit checkout prerequisites.
